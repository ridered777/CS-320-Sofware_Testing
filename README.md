How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Best coding practices are at this point ingrained within my momement to moment activities when writing software. These practices help code be functional and secure from the getgo. Beyond that, the instructor in this course was great at providing feedback and comments so those were always read, integrated into future assignmetns and addressed on the intial commented code project so that moving forward it is correct. This also meant that when it was time to package all the sections together and submit them for project 1, very little additional work was required.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The users needs were implemented every step of the way. At the start of each unit, a requirements document was given to us for that section - referencing this regularly was an important part of designing to not only make sure the needs are all met but also to make sure the design isn't over-shooting them causing extra cost and time. Scope creep is something to always be mindful of.

How do I approach designing software?

The requirements list, technical requirements and UML Class diagrams are something that I have always used as a approach to designing software. I find these are the most practically useful of the design tools, and directly lower the amount of time or mistakes made when actually implementing and programing a piece of software. In the future, this will continue to be my technique to analyze and design systems. For this particular project, the tasks were simple so UML design was no required and I was able to utilize the given requrements document exclusively to design the software.
